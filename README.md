# JavaScript-Challenge-Password-Generator
HW Challenge #3


## Project Description

This homework assginment taught us how to generate a password that meets a certain criteria to increase security for sensitive data that the user has. We had to make sure that the password only contains the characters that the user selects "OK" to. When the user clicks "Cancel" that means they do not want to that/those specific character(s) to be part of the generated password. I wanted to challenge myself and added a "reset button" so the user can easily reset if they made a mistake instead of clicking on the refresh button. This helped me to impove on my javascript skills. I struggled on this since Javascript so far has been the most challenging topic we have worked on so far. My live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section.The code was also already provided by UCSD Coding Bootcamp and they had already added a media query to make it user friendly for those who choose to use the <a href=https://hannybear88.github.io/JavaScript-Challenge-Password-Generator/" target="_blank">deployed application</a> on either a mobile and/or tablet.
